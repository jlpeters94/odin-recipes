		<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
		<p>This is another one-meal-in-a-pot dish. It contains soup, meat and vegetables all cooked together in one delicious broth. Terrific during cooler weather. Serve hot alone or with rice.</p>
		<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>4 ½ pounds beef short ribs</li>
			<li>1 quart water</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed</li>
			<li>2 onions, chopped</li>
			<li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
			<li>2 carrots, cut in chunks</li>
			<li>2 stalks celery, quartered</li>
			<li>1 chayote squash, peeled and quartered</li>
			<li>2 potatoes, quartered</li>
			<li>salt to taste</li>
			<li>¼ head cabbage, cut into wedges</li>
		</ul>	
		<h3>STEPS</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the beef ribs in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for 5 minutes. Drain; discard the cooking water (the ribs will not be fully cooked).</li>
			<li>Return the beef to the pot. Pour in the 1 quart water, peppercorns, onions, and beef bouillon. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Skim any fat floating on the surface. Stir in the carrots, celery, chayote, and potatoes; cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt. Add cabbage and cook an additional 5 minutes.</li>
